### 2. Send a Message to the AI
- **Action**:  
  - User types a message in the input field.
  - On pressing **Enter** or clicking the **Send** button, the message is sent.
- **Behavior**:  
  - The message appears in the chat UI immediately.
  - A mocked AI response is fetched and displayed below the user message.

---

### 3. AI Response Feedback (Thumbs Up/Down)
- **Action**:  
  - User hovers over any AI response.
- **Behavior**:  
  - Feedback icons (**Thumbs Up & Thumbs Down**) become visible.
  - Clicking one of these records the feedback for that AI message.

---

### 4. End a Conversation & Provide Final Feedback
- **Action**:

  - On submit:
    - The conversation and feedback are saved (mock API call).

---

### 5. Access Past Conversations
- **Action**:  
  - User clicks on any listed past conversation from the **sidebar**

## ‚úÖ Technical Stack

## ü§î Technical Choices, Design Decisions and Tradeoffs

### 1. **MirageJS**:
üõ†Ô∏è Used to mock backend APIs without depending on actual backend development or network conditions. Useful for both development and production demos, ensuring the app works as expected, even with mocked responses. The VITE_ENABLE_MIRAGE=true flag adds flexibility in enabling/disabling Mirage.   

### 2. **End Conversation functionality**:

After the user clicks **"End Conversation"**, the input field is hidden, and the user is encouraged to create a **new conversation** instead of continuing the old one.

#### 1. **Encourages Focused, Contextual Interactions**
- **Why it matters**:  
  Ending a conversation sets a **contextual boundary**.
- **Benefit**:  
  Encourages users to **refocus** their questions or discussions in a new, relevant session rather than cluttering old conversations with unrelated messages.

#### 2. **Improves Organization**
- **Why it matters**:  
  Each conversation is treated as an **independent unit**.
- **Benefit**:  
  Makes it easier to **organize, retrieve, and check back** conversations later. Useful for **feedback analytics** and **training data** separation.

#### 3. **[Technical] Simplifies State Management**
- **Why it matters**:  
  There‚Äôs no need to track whether the AI should still be ‚Äúin context‚Äù after a session ends.
- **Benefit**:  
  Cleaner **frontend logic** and **context management**‚Äîno accidental mixing of old/new contexts.

## ‚≠ê Features left out that should be considered immediately
- **Autofill input from suggestions in New Conversation**
- **Do not force user for feedback to end conversation. Have a skip button in Feedback Modal**
- **Error handling and retry options**
- **Support for markdown and formatting in input field**
- **Rename conversations in list to find easily and have clear organised chats**
- **Support for Searching conversations in Sidebar**
- **Make Sidebar collapsible**
- **Dark Theme Support**
